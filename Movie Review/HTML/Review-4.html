                    Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor <br>
                     and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed <br>
                     pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny. Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the <br>
                     extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character <br>
                     and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do. <br>
                     Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. <br>
                     Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time. <br>
                     Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant <br>
                     but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish. <br>
                     The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. <br>
                     The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better. <br>
