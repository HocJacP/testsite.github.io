                <p>
                    Saw it a hundred times, and from crying in laughter to making your stomach hurt from laughing so hard, <br>
                    it is one of the funniest movies of all time. Caught it again recently for the over one hundredth time and tried to view it as an older skeptic, <br>
                    and I laughed even harder at scenes that originally were not as funny as the funniest ones. It's just an infallible, <br>
                    brilliant comedy that pushes the envelope just enough without going too far like some recent imitator movies of it have done. <br>
                    <br>
                    It's just nonstop laughs, incredible editing and pacing to never stop being funny, and once you think you've seen the funniest scenes, <br>
                    it just keeps getting funnier and delivering all the way up to the end and epilogue. This is imo easily the funniest movie ever made, <br>
                    and nothing really comes close to it. It's hard to believe, but it actually has a good, coherent backstory plot too, <br>
                    which also allows the supporting cast to shine in their minor comedy roles as well while making the story actually make sense. <br>
                    It never gets old. <br>
