                    Pixar again shows us their superior skills in 3D animation and to a lesser extent this time, <br>
                     the storytelling. There is so much attention to detail, that you are left gazing at the screen in awe. <br>
                     The 2 hours races by, and afterwards you are left with the satisfaction of having just seen something quite unique and surreal. <br>
                    <br>
                    It's a kids film of course, so there is little need to point out the predictable story elements - <br>
                     which exist in Cars more so than previous Pixar films such as The Incredibles. <br>
                     Cars is less daring, is safer in its approach. There are no surprising or wild deviations on the fairly straight road the story follows. <br>
                     But nevertheless, it's all very cool stuff, and the story is entertaining enough. Cars is a must see Pixar film - even if the visuals steal the show. <br>
