                    Tommy Boy is a classic comedy that's stood the test of time.With Chris Farley playing the key role of Tommy, the son of a wealthy factory owner. <br>
                     He's got to work his way up to eventually inherit the family business, but sadly he's not a great salesman. <br>
                     Throughout the film, there's no shortage of both hilariously clever humor, and dumb dad jokes. <br>
                     My overall rating for the movie is a 9/10. It's just such a classic and Chris Farley and David Spade play their roles so well. <br>
